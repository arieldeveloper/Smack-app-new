# Smack app 

The app is fully functional, and has login functionality, as well as instant chat compatibility using SocketIO. 
Smack is inspired by slack and works very similarly. 

Completely built in swift using Cocoa Pods and Alamofire, SwiftyJSON and SocketIO

This was a big learning experience for me in swift 4 and taught me a lot about JSON and web requests as well as sockets.
